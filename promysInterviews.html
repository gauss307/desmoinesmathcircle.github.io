            <h2>Interviews at PROMYS 2024!</h2>
            <div class="author">Author: Maximillian Roach</div>
            <div class="date">August 4, 2024</div>
            <div class="pI-intro">
                <p>This summer I attended PROMYS (Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists) at Boston 
                University. The program places focus on number theory, and for many students it is 
                their first exposure to pure mathematics. Every morning, the entire program attends the 
                number theory lecture, taught by either Prof. Glenn Stevens or Prof. Henry Cohn. 
                First-year students typically put most of their effort into the number theory problem 
                set, whereas second-year students participate in advanced seminars. This year, the 
                advanced seminars were Galois Theory and Graph Theory. Interestingly, the problem sets 
                given each day are three days ahead of the lecture, and it is firmly emphasized that 
                students should not use the internet when p-setting (a term refering to working on your 
                problem set, and one that I have grown attached to). We are then able to more purely 
                explore fundamental concepts, perhaps reproducing the processes that brilliant 
                mathematicians went through to derive theorems and axioms. </p>

                <p>For me, PROMYS was a surprising experience because it was the first time I dealt
                with rigorous mathematics. 
                In the first week, we began by constructing an "inventory" for the set of integers. This is a 
                collection of axioms that describe the integers, distinguish them from other sets such 
                as the real numbers or Gaussian integers, and are needed to prove theorems about 
                integers. Examples of such axioms are the Distributive Property, existence of a zero
                element, and the Well Ordering Principle. I found it so difficult to come up with 
                axioms for my inventory because I have been dealing with integers since primary school. 
                How am I supposed to know the characteristics that are unique to integers? My peers and 
                and I had discovered that we had taken for granted many concepts that seemed to need no 
                explaining because we had been working with them for years. An especially humorous instance
                of this was on the midterm. A section on the test required absolute rigor, meaning you 
                have to cite all axioms you use and prove any theorems that are not given. There was a 
                certain problem that gave us trouble: Prove there exist no integers between 0 and 1. 
                This may seem trivial, but almost all first-years were baffled, me included, when we 
                received our test booklets to find a score of 5/12. The fatal mistake we had collectively made
                was forgetting to prove 0 < 1. Only 1 student in the program earned full points. </p>

                <p>When I first arrived at PROMYS I found it very difficult to make friends. Everyone seemed to 
                have taken advanced pure math courses, qualified for olympiads, attended other prestigious math camps, 
                or were simply much smarter than me. Collaboration on p-sets is highly emphasized but after 
                the first week I pretty much barricaded myself in my room to work on math. I told myself that this 
                was because I didn't want other people spoiling things for me. I wanted to come across novel insights on 
                my own. Although this might have been true in some sense, it was more the case that I was afraid 
                that people would judge me when they discovered something and I had to keep asking questions 
                because I didn't understand. By the fourth week, I had begun counting down the days 
                until the end of the program, which would mark my return to the place and people I was accustomed to.
                But I eventually found the group of people I fit in with. For those last two weeks, we went to meals, 
                studied for finals, and attended minicourses together. On the day of departure, as the ranks of the 
                program began to slowly dwindle away, I was surprised to find myself tearing up while hugging and saying 
                goodbyes to friends as they left. It is undoubtable that the mathematics at PROMYS is amazing, but 
                the community there is its most valuable aspect. I discovered that the math community, with some exceptions,
                is not one that casts judgment upon you when you struggle with a concept. Instead, it is one that welcomes
                everyone who is passionate about learning and shares that certain indescribable characteristic everyone 
                interested in STEM seems to possess. 
                </p>

                <p>Each student is assigned a counselor. The purpose of the counselors is to aid students in 
                learning the material and solving their problem sets, but never explicitely providing solutions.
                They are all extremely skilled in advanced mathematics and teaching others. 
                During my six weeks at PROMYS, I interviewed several counselors, hoping to gain insight on math
                beyond college and other related topics. </p>
                
                <p>The counselors I intereviewed are: </p>

        <div id="Hari Iyer" class=" inter" style="display:none">
            <h2>Hari Iyer - Harvard</h2>
            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I didn't participate so much in competition math. I made it to the AIME. I did well
                on the AIME, but not enough to make the Olympiad. Other than that, I did the Ross program after my 
                sophomore year, and then I took many college classes at a nearby college, and I did some research with 
                a professor there.
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Oh that's such a hard question. I think most of the people who do well in college math and 
                research are not super competitive or deep into the math competition world. It depends on what you mean by 
                competition math. If it's people who are doing well, like locally, that's one thing. But there's a difference
                between people who make MOP and the people who win MOP. So the people who win everything are just generally 
                good at things, and they can do whatever they want, whatever they set their mind to. So I think in that sense, 
                there's a correlation at the very top. But it only goes one way. And that's because it's only a correlation. 
                There are so many other factors you can't really divorce from each other. Like, these people are already very 
                good. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I enjoy seeing people understand things. When someone gets something that I explained it
                feels good. Also, I enjoy explaining things that I'm interested in at the moment, because then it gives me a 
                reason to study it carefully. It helps me with my own work. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So far, I think I've been very fortunate. I have a frustrating moment that's not so much 
                frustrating. But when you leave college, I mean, I'm starting grad school in the fall, and you see all your
                friends making a lot more, like, a lot mroe money, and living a very nice lifestyle. You start to wonder 
                whether you should do that too. And a lot of people think about this a lot earlier, but I just happen to be
                a little late to the game. So I mean, I'm considering that there are a lot of things I didn't try when I was 
                in college, like I didn't intern anywhere. I just did research on the summers. The question is framed negatively,
                but I think doubt is a good thing. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I did some in high school. I reached out to a professor at my local university. I just showed
                him the stuff that I did at the Ross program, so then eh knew that I was, like, legit. And then this was very, very 
                lucky. He was just very gracious and happened to have something to think about, something very hands on.
                So we worked on that for a bit. I mean, it wasn't anything huge, but in college, I think this whole process is a lot 
                more structured and in some sense, less competitive. So in high school, there are maybe a few programs around the 
                country that formalize doig research for high school students. Like at PROMYS, there are some research labs, or there's 
                RSI, there's MIT PRIMES, things like that. But at the undergraduate level, the government proivdes a lot of funding for 
                REU programs. These are research experiences for undergraduates. These are scattered around the country, lots of 
                different subjects that you can choose, and I think many people also just opt to reach out to professors at their 
                schools and do that. There's also the world of industry research which I wish I'd explored more, but there's probably
                a lot more funding beind that too. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So this is my first year at PROMYS. I did the Ross program in hgih school which is very similar.
                As a student, I learned how to work, like a lot, and I learned why rigor is interesting or important or 
                even possible in the first place. A lot of people don't really think about rigor before they come to places like this, 
                very carefully. And it gives you, I guess, a slight edge in terms of just understanding formal arguments. As a counselor,
                you learn to read things very well. Like you learn to read your students' work carefully and efficiently, and you get a lot 
                better at spotting when there's an error, or on the other hand, when there's something interesting going on. 
                And you get faster. And I notice that when I try to read other things now I apply a similar critical viewpoint, and then that's 
                really nice as a counselor. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So I'm starting graduate school in the fall, planning to study number theory. I have a lot of time to 
                figure out what exactly I want to do, maybe stay in academia or research or something, if I'm good at it, and if I can make 
                enough money and live in a place I like. But other than that, I would consider, probably industry positions that are higher
                paying and well located. 
                </div>

            </div>
        </div>



        <div id="Angeline Peng" class=" inter" style="display:none">
            <h2>Angeline Peng - MIT</h2>
            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Um, so I went to a small charter school, and nobody at my school really did math, 
                    very seriously. Um, so I did, I did some competition math. I was never really that good, nor was 
                    I really motivated to get good. Because I had to go to another place to take the competition and 
                    I didn't know anybody who did it either. I'm from Singapore, and in Singapore, I also did math. 
                    There were more people doing math there. And when I moved to America, I kept doing math, but not 
                    as much anymore. So I applied to PROMYS , and I did the PROMYS application p-set and I was like, 
                    wow, this is so much fun. This is way better than competition math So I got into PROMYS as a 
                    rising junior And so I did PROMYS every year. I love PROMYS . So that's like, the main thing 
                    I did in high school. I didn't really find the motivation to do a lot of competition or, like, 
                    math in general during the school year, so I really just, like, worked on my classes and stuff. </div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">, Yeah, um, I think the correlation is it exists. I think if you're good at 
                    competition math, you do have the skills like, that helps you be good at higher math, 
                    but it's like, very different. You can do very, very well at competitions, like, IMO, gold medalists 
                    but that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to do well on like, I know an gold medalist who got a B or a C 
                    on an algebra test, right? So it's like, it definitely helps. Like these kids, they pick up things 
                    pretty fast. I definitely have like, I feel like I spend more time doing readings and stuff compared 
                    to them, so they're really quick. But I feel like math, like higher level math, is a lot of like, you 
                    just keep working at it. And like, you just keep thinking about it and just working with examples. 
                    And like, the more intuition you build, the more experience you build with it. It just translates to 
                    being better at math, right? That being said, it definitely helps to be good in a competition math, 
                    but it's different. You have to like also put in the time. </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">um, I don't know. I think mainly because when I was, like, early on in high school, I didn't 
                    like math a lot because I was not good at competition math. So I hated that. so I like and then I feel like 
                    worrying about competition math Like, the thing with comp math is you need to, get the quick insight a lot 
                    of the times. And I just didnt get it um, but there's, like, a still, a lot of cool things about math. And 
                    like, when I hear people talk about, like, not liking math, it's like you just haven't seen a lot of math. 
                    It's like the wrong impression. And I, like, do want to expose people to like that kind of math first before 
                    they make judgments about whether or not they want to do math. But like, I feel like so many people miss out, 
                    like I'm talking like generic maybe not like math math people, but like, generic people. Like, they hate math 
                    because they think it's just computation. There's, like, so much more to it. But yeah, like, I guess it's 
                    because it's, I like math, and I think people have the wrong impression about it. You know, you just want 
                    to correct that.</div>

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Oh, I mean, so many, so many, like, even when you're solving problems and you don't 
                    really get it, like, that's always really bad. What helps me? Perhaps it's like, not really the most. 
                    It's not healthy. But like, I just go, I'm not a quitter, and I can't have people know that I'm a 
                    quitter. You know, it's like, it's like, how you go on a run with someone else and you both, like, 
                    run further, because you guys, like, mutually, don't want to be the first one to stop. That's like, 
                    that's, that's the thing I love. Yeah, I mean, like, there was, there was one piece set, I remember 
                    in my college that was really bad, and, like, a lot of people dropped the class because of that p-set. 
                    But then I was like, I'm not a quitter. I cannot live this down if, I don't do it. And then, you know, 
                    like, I think, especially when you're young, it's easy to think, I can't do this immediately, I can 
                    never do it. But like, you'll be so surprised by like, you just keep working at it. It like, falls 
                    into place. And also, it's like, okay to ask people for help. And like, you understand it later.</div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I guess my main experience with research was at promise when I was a student, I actually 
                    didn't like doing research labs, because it was very I wasn't very into the topic, like, I think there's 
                    very limited math that you can do when you are when you don't know that much math. A lot of math research 
                    requires, like having the foundation. So I didn't like it. I didn't like the math I was working with, 
                    because a lot of it is, like combo problems here, like, bounding, oh my god, bounding is so un fun. So yeah, 
                    I don't I didn't like it that much. But also, like, I'm excited to do research, like, this coming year, when 
                    I have more background and I can do more work into the stuff that I'm interested in. But like, it's really 
                    a lot of, like, you get a problem, and you just sit and play with it for a while, and you ask questions 
                    about it, and like, oh no. Like, how you approach a PROMYS problem, but like, a very long term skill. And, 
                    yeah, it's also nothing more interested in. My research lab was actually a lot, was actually quite 
                    interesting, and I might think about it more sometime in the future. TM, I'll get back to it. But, 
                    like, I don't know, like, after a while, if the problem isn't something that interests you on a deep 
                    level, you really do get bored of it because you think about it for such a long time, and this is also 
                    my issue, because I get bored of problems pretty quickly. Yeah, I like certain kinds of math, and it wasn't 
                    really that. </div>

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Oh, um, just knowing what pure math really looks like. Because everybody really knows 
                    what competition math looks like, and that's pure math is nowhere like that. And I think math is, like, 
                    really cool. I mean, promise has changed me a lot in the sense that, like I used to not like math, 
                    and then now I really do like math, but, yeah, you find a new way of doing math, and also how to 
                    approach problem solving. I think it helps with math in general, and this is like jump started at 
                    PROMYS But like, as I'm working through math, I learned that, like, a lot of problems, like, if you 
                    just put time and effort into it, and your progress is definitely not linear. Like, it's not clear 
                    that you're getting closer to your to, like, solving the problem, because you're still stuck on the 
                    problem, and then, like, sudden, suddenly you're unstuck, because a lot of the growth is hidden that 
                    you make when you do math. And so, like, after doing promise, like having this experience, and like, 
                    I learned so much math every year during promise, and like, the maturity that you give for it's so so 
                    much, like, I definitely believe way more in, like, hidden progress. And like, any work you do is good 
                    work, even if it's not getting anywhere.</div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Yeah, I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do. Career wise, money is great and academia is 
                    hard to get good sources of money, good or even consistent sources of money. Um I mean, I think I'm treating 
                    math more as like, like right now I'm majoring in it, and it's like, if I'm gonna work in something, 
                    then math is like, gonna be my hobby more than something that's I'm directly gonna use in my job. But 
                    like, as I said earlier, I learned a lot of life lessons from doing math, and so I think that's, like, 
                    very important. But I'm also, like, maybe going to academia, because I really enjoy teaching. So like, 
                    if I go into academia, I can very directly apply the math that I know into that, but, like, I'm definitely 
                    not going to need that if I'm going to go into, like, coding or CS or something like that.</div>
                
                    <div class="question">how does advanced math differ from math like most people are accustomed to 
                        learning in high school?
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">Yeah, I think math in high school, okay, in high school, it's very formulaic, and you 
                        can, like, lay out all the steps you do, or, like, there's a way to make it very formulaic. And I 
                        think that was what I found like school, grade school math to be. And I think math is. you know what? 
                        Like, I think it's fair that people don't like math because math is difficult and like, but like, 
                        we shouldn't not like something because it's difficult. But that's like, that's not the mentality to 
                        lead life with, um, pure math is very It's very pretty. I think in school, it focuses a lot on the 
                        computational aspects, but not very much on the prettiness, or, I don't know, it really like, doesn't 
                        give you time to explore. And I think, like, math is a lot, a lot of it, a lot of getting results. 
                        And this is what my algebra professor said about research. It's like, you don't really pick a problem 
                        and then solve the problem. More often than not. When you're doing research, you pick an object of 
                        study, like, I'm gonna study this specific group, I'm gonna study this specific like thing in math, 
                        and then you study, you understand it a lot, and when you do that, results pop out. With math in 
                        school, the emphasis is on getting the problem solved. Math is, you get an object and you you study 
                        it, and then results pop out from studying. It's about it's about the journey not the destination. 
                        That's what math is in the end. And yeah, and it's dumb that, like, yeah, they don't really talk about 
                        the journey. They just care about the destination. And to be fair, it's all the kids fault anyways, 
                        because they're like, oh, teacher, when am I ever gonna need this in my life? And then the teacher 
                        gives them a problem where they need to apply in their real life, and then they cry about it.</div>

            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">or middle school I started with a lot of competition math. In high 
                    school I continued doing so and I was very engaged, and that was probably the thing
                     that took up most of my time outside of school. I stopped being so engaged after, 
                     say, junior year of high school, but I guess after my 10th grade, I went to promise, 
                     which where I am now, and I went back to promise for the summer after end of the 
                     summer after my senior year. So I went back three years, and I think that was a very 
                     good exposure to what math is like in college and beyond.I think the main place where I had social capital in, you know, my old middle and high school was 
                     from me being smart. I was the person that people could ask me for, like, homework help. 
                     I could be the person that, like, they asked me to, like, you know, like test answers or 
                     whatever, that I could be, the person that they could rely on to, you know, do well in 
                     my competitions or whatnot. And I think having the opportunity to engage with people who 
                     had similar interests to me, and who I could talk about math with, and who I could just 
                     interact with without being so self conscious about, like, what I provide to others and 
                     how others perceive me was very, was just, was very refreshing. And although a lot of 
                     these people weren't from my area, I talked a lot with them, like, online, and I'm beat 
                     up with them, like, whenever we go to, like state competitions, and like, when we travel 
                     to like natural competitions. And so having that kind of friendship, and a lot of people,
                      I, like, a lot of people from there, I actually like, very close with now, like, for 
                      example, one of my closest friends from from North Carolina starting middle school. 
                      We actually had dinner yesterday because he's like, he's around because he goes to MIT, 
                      and so having that community was was was very solid for my upbringing.</div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer"> I think there is very little correlation. In fact, there might be negative 
                    correlation. The reason being is that I think if you do a lot of competition math, you gain 
                    the impression that you're very good at math. And so I guess I'm, like, speaking for myself. 
                    So this is all from like, the i perspective. But once I got into college, I realized that there 
                    are a lot of people who had much great, much greater exposure to college math than I had, and I 
                    thought I had a good amount, because I went to promise for three years, and I felt like a lot 
                    of people who went to promise before me, and who went to like these, took to college, you 
                    know, Excel very well in terms of math. But I went there and I was, I suddenly felt very 
                    behind. And a lot of these people had many, many years of just like, I don't know, like studying 
                    group theory or studying, like linear algebra before me. Like even some some high schools like, 
                    offer these classes, like in, like, at their high school, it's just like, if you've already taken 
                    these classes before, like, how am I supposed to like, how am I supposed to compete with that? 
                    And I think competition math is teaches you a lot of math, but it is not the same kind of skill 
                    set as pure math in a lot of ways. I think there's some intersect. Gym, perhaps, and like some 
                    niche fields, but I think generally, pure math likes to the most important thing of pure math is 
                    like, is language which is very which is something that, like Glenn always talks about you want, 
                    you want to express your like, a certain idea, and so you try to, like, formulate the proper 
                    like definitions and the proper language in order to express that idea. And then you develop the 
                    idea, like, very abstractly from the ground up. Whereas in competition math is you have these, 
                    like, these tools in place already. So you're not generating anything new, but you're like, 
                    applying like that, that the novelty in competition math is you're taking these ideas and 
                    you're trying to apply it. You're trying to, like, combine them in, like, a more creative way. 
                    And so there's, like, a small subtlety there, but it's, I think it's like, it's very profoundly 
                    different, like, they're very fundamentally different. And I think, for example, like the way of 
                    thinking for competition, math, maybe more in line with, say, I don't know, like, like, computer 
                    science or something, or you have these, like, these algorithms in place, and you're, like, aware 
                    of these algorithms. And the question is not, like, how can I, I don't know, construct a new I mean,
                     like, research, of course, like, exists in these areas, but especially like, within, like, the college 
                     classroom setting, it's not like, how can like, construct these like, new things, but like, rather, 
                     okay, I've like, learned this algorithm now. How can I apply it to these problems in like, very, very 
                     unique ways? So yeah, I think actually, a lot of my competition friends end up not staying in pure math. 
                     And the people who do stay in pure math are the ones who, the vast majority of them are the ones who had a 
                     lot of, like, more pure math experience when they were in high school, which makes sense, like, if you 
                     studied a lot of like, a certain subject in high school, and you're, like, bound to study it more in 
                     college. It's just that I think competition math should not be equated to peer math. And so, like, 
                     if you see them as, like, two different subjects, and it makes complete sense, like, you study to say 
                     one thing, and you're trying to, like, study this other thing, which is, like, very different from what 
                     you just studied. And so it's like these things, like, won't translate. And a lot of people like, they 
                     think that it's like, the same thing. Or me, I thought it was the same thing, and then I, you know, 
                     I went in with this, like, this idea that I could, just, like, you know, do well, and then it didn't 
                     turn out that way.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">I did not participate in competition math, but I I had, let's say, a very privileged 
                    math upbringing. I my parents realized that I was really a fan of the stuff since I was a very little 
                    kid, and my dad bought me tons and tons of math books ever since I was like seven, and I'm immensely 
                    grateful for that. But what that meant was that by the time I entered high school, I actually knew a 
                    lot more math than most of my peers, so the school agreed to do a special thing where I would have 
                    one on one classes with the physics teacher, Mr. Klotz, who would like just the two of us do a math 
                    class, and he would teach me things like multivariable calculus and linear algebra and differential 
                    equations and sort of, I think the last year or the second to last year of high school, he said to me, 
                    Hey, I remember you saying that you didn't feel as strong in geometry. So I got this book. I don't 
                    really know what it's about, but it's this book called Riemannian geometry by Brazilian mathematician 
                    Manfredo Perdigão do Carmo, and I'm probably mispronouncing that, which is not really the sort of 
                    geometry that perhaps either of us were expecting. Riemannian geometry is all about the study of like 
                    curved surfaces in many dimensional space. And I think I I spent a lot more time with the book than he 
                    did, and I eventually was just like me explaining what was happening to him. But yeah, I mean, that's 
                    not a very typical thing. Like, I did not really experience the high school math curriculum that almost 
                    all high schoolers in the country experience. Like, I have no idea what the difference between algebra 
                    one and Algebra Two is, just because I had this weird arrangement where I skipped all of that, which is 
                    not to say that that's like a prerequisite for you know, becoming a mathematician is starting really 
                    early. Like, I had a friend named davidowski, who was not into math in high school, like a classmate of 
                    mine my same year, who was not like the same level of math kid that I was at the time, but he fell in 
                    love with math in college and is now doing math or, I forget if it's Masters or PhD in UW Madison, and 
                    knows a lot more of algebraic geometry and related fields than I do. So He was here not too long ago for 
                    the mordell conference, which was at MIT. And, you know, I only was able to make it for one of the talks, 
                    just because of the way promise and timing worked out. But you know, I have very little confidence that 
                    I would be able to understand most of the talks, and it was his field, so he felt, you know, very at home 
                    in it, even though, you know, he did not start before high school the same way I did. </div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I mean, they are very different skills, right? I want to, I don't want to say that 
                    one is, like, useless, like, you know, I think a lot of people say they're afraid that, like, you 
                    know, training for competition math only lets you be good at competition math, which, like, there 
                    is some truth of that that is very different from research. But, you know, it's, like, I think it's 
                    a very fun thing, and, like, you know, a very mentally demanding thing, the same way that, like, 
                    learning to solve a Rubik's Cube very fast, or, you know, memorize a deck of cards in a shuffle deck 
                    of cards in under a minute is very impressive, like, but I don't think that it has like the same 
                    relation to college math and research math that it might seem, because, like. It. I feel like there's 
                    competition questions, textbook questions and research questions, and they all have very different 
                    flavor, right? A textbook question, you are expected to be able to solve it with the techniques that 
                    happened in the chapter. All right? A competition question, you don't know what the tools you're 
                    supposed to use to bring to the table are, but you know that there is a solution that someone else 
                    has figured out, that this is a good level of difficulty for people who know about you know these 
                    tools, and there exists a solution, and we have a few in this document over here. And then research 
                    math is you have no idea if the question you're asking is solvable. You have no idea if you're even 
                    asking the right questions. And it's a lot more exploratory, right? Because research happens on the 
                    order of, like, months, if you're lucky, very often, right? And you know, competition happens in 
                    the order of half an hour. And you know, I don't know if there's a particular time scale for textbook 
                    questions, I will say like competition questions very often there it's good to, like, grab one from 
                    an old contest and stick with one problem for half an hour, or do like a session with a community 
                    on one problem for half an hour, and just like absorb everything you can get from it, because a lot 
                    of them are deeper than you are able to appreciate in the time constraints that these problems have. 
                    For what it’s worth I was, you know, and as I said, I never did competitions, but I did have a hand 
                    in setting a competition once a high school competition. So Yale has hosts something called maths, a 
                    high school math competition. Also girls in math is another thing that happens at Yale. And when I 
                    say Yale hosted, I mean it's entirely student run. The students come up with the questions, run out 
                    of time to play test the questions, because they're students and have other work to do. And then the 
                    questions end up being accidentally too hard, which is definitely what happened when I was involved 
                    like I I came on. This is 2022 I think I came on to that very late, and they said, Hey, we do not 
                    have enough questions for this competition that's happening in just like a few weeks. We need to just 
                    brainstorm and come up with a bunch of random stuff as quickly as possible. Five of the things I came 
                    up with ended up on there. I have no idea if they were the right level of difficulty, because we 
                    couldn't get people to test them before it happened. Actually, that's a lie. I gave one to someone I 
                    knew on Discord who happened to be like an IMO medalist, I think, and he solved it in the span of 15 
                    minutes, which is pretty impressive. But like that test, the time controls were such that you only 
                    really had five minutes for question, which probably todl us that wasn't the right move. It ended up 
                    being like, the max score was eight out of 12 on a bunch of rounds. Po-Shen Loh's daughter won it. </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I mean, I get excited by this stuff. I like to get other people excited about the same 
                    same stuff stuff I'm excited by. There's also like a selfish level to it, which is that I understand 
                    something a lot better if I explain it to someone else. Right? The minicourses that I gave, right? So the 
                    counselors can give minicourses to the students, generally around an hour. The only reason I was able to give 
                    those mini courses was because I had tried to explain those same topics one on one to people in the past, 
                    and I saw like where they got stuck or where I realized that I didn't fully understand it as much as I thought
                    I did, and that informed how I was able to talk about it, and that sort of informed how my lesson plan was for 
                    proving that Pi is irrational, or explaining what homology is. I have this online community. I'm a part of a 
                    Discord server focused on math, and any time I explain to someone on there wat like an injunction is in category 
                    theory or what have you, I find I understand the topic by the end of it way better than I did at the start. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I'm kind of in the middle of one now, and have been for a while. Well, I mean, here's the thing, when 
                    I was younger, because, as I mentioned, I started studying math pretty young, because my parents sort of put a lot of actual 
                    money into buying a lot of books for me. And, you know, my prize, like the one possession I have, material possession, I have 
                    on this earth that I value above everything else is my bookshelf, partly for sentimental value. Anyway, I remember at one point 
                    , when I was really young, deciding that I had hit a brick wall with differential equations, that I had learned calculus before 
                    most poeple learned calculus, and then I got to differential qeuations. I could get it, and that was fine. That was where my wall was. 
                    And then eventually I learned differential equations, and I think that was just like this mental thing for me, of like, okay, maybe 
                    this concept of a wall doesn't actually exist. So one thing I've been trying to learn for a while is algebraic geometry and 
                    commutative algebra, and for whatever reason, every time I've picked up a book to try to learn about it, I've gotten stuck.
                    I've got a tiny bit into the book and said, okay, I can't understand what's happening here anymore. And, like, I was reading all these
                    algebraic geometry books, and was like, okay, I think the issue is that I need to brush up on a prereq. Maybe I need to learn some 
                    commutative algebra first. So I got a commutative algebra book, a big fat one written by someone named Eisenbud. I was like, okay, this 
                    is too much. I'll give this back to the person I borrowed it from. I'm going to get a smalled one called Atiyah and MacDonald's. That's 
                    sort of where I am. And right now it's more that particular book is more exercises than exposition, like basically like a small 
                    amount of text and then a lot of exercises. And I was thinking I would be able to get to them, some of them during PROMYS. And it turns out 
                    I just didn't have any time. But like, I've just been frustrated with this one subject of commutative algebra for a long time. 
                    And like, I'm just persevering because I know that I've hit a wall in the past and been able to get through it.  
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I was involved in an REU in college. So REU stands for research experience for undergrads. This is during COVID. It was entirely
                    virtual. The other two people on my team understood the topic way better than I did. I did not really have a great time, and I don't think I got much 
                    out of it, which is a shame. I mean, I've talked to other poeple since then, and they said that REUs are overrated, which may be true. I can't really
                    say from where I'm sitting. But, like, that's the only formal reserach experience I've had. But I don't know. I'm constantly thinking about random stuff.
                    Like, right now I'm thinking about these random probability puzzles. I'm going to explain this one niche thing. Choose four random points between zero 
                    and one, sort them from least to greatest, label them A, B, C, D, from least to greatest. And then you can ask things like, what's the probability that A 
                    squared plus D squared is bigger than B squared plus C squared? So sum of the outer squares is bigger than the sum of the inner 
                    squares. Or you can ask, what's the probability that one over A plus one over D is bigger than one over B plus one over C, same thing but with reciprocals. 
                    Well it works out that with the first one with squares, the probability is exactly the natural logarithm of 2. And with the second one, the probability is 
                    exactly pi squared minus 9. And there's a whole family of generalizations of these problems which are leading me to some wacky integrals that I don't really 
                    know how to solve. But hopefully the internet does so I've been asking some questions on math StackExchange. I  was just synthesizing other 
                    stuff I'd been thinking about in the past. There's a certain geometric shape you can get by intersecting three hyperboloids that ends up, surprisingly, to 
                    have a volume of exactly log two, for some reason. And then I was thinking about some other probability stuff, and then I realized, hey, wait a minute, 
                    that first thing, the volume thing, can be recast into the language of probability, and then it becomes this weird puzzle kind of, 
                    yeah, I don't know. There's another topology thing that I was thinking about a while ago which, like I was trying to ask people online, 
                    hey, does anyone know the solution to this one very specific topology question? And then nobody ever saw those posts I made, and then I solved it myself,
                     because no one else was and that came from thinking about a random thing in a book I read once, or like, I read another thing in a book more recently, 
                     which was, like this number theory thing. And I realized, hey, if you change that two to a three, what happens, and then that led me to, like, 
                     discovering this number sequence that seemingly did not exist online, but had a bunch of really weird properties. So I ended up submitting that to 
                     the OAS, which is this online database, or it's called the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. Anyway, just like, stuff I'm reading about and 
                     realizing, like, hey, that makes me think about something else I saw once. I don't know, but like, that's not formal research, in the sense that, 
                     like, I never turned any of them into a paper. I never really wrote any of this stuff down, except, like, bits and pieces of it on Stack Exchange and 
                     on like, Discord servers or a Facebook group called actually good mathematics problems.

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer"> I really like teaching, and so this is my second year as a counselor. I've never been 
                    here in any other capacity than as a counselor. So I've never been here as a student, but I was here last 
                    year. Last year, I taught three mini courses. Well, two mini courses and one counselor seminar. This year, 
                    I taught too many courses, and I just had a lot of fun doing that. It was just like explaining this one 
                    topic of my choice to a classroom full of people is something I don't very often get the chance to do 
                     so I'm grateful for promise, for the opportunity to do that, also 
                    just the opportunity to hang out with these incredibly, mathematically talented kids who are as excited 
                    about this subject as I Am  and willing to learn and all that.  
                    How exactly did you phrase the question, like,  what unique insights or understanding 
                    have you gained? I mean,  I don't promise is a lot of work on the student side, like you know, 
                    as someone who's never been a student, it seems like a lot of work to do all of these problems every 
                    night, even though you obviously don't have to complete the whole thing every night, and sort of doing 
                    the exploration on your own first before the lecture gets to it. I think that's a very like great way to 
                    do pedagogy, to do teaching that doesn't really have the opportunity to exist in a lot of other places 
                    because, like, it's such a full focused thing that you can't really have that sort of experience taking 
                    a lecture course in university. For example, just because, if you're taking a lecture course at university, 
                    you're also taking four or five others, right, or three or four others, and you're splitting your time. And 
                    this is like condensing a whole, like semester long or a year long course into the span of a month and a half, 
                    and asking students to focus on this one thing extremely deeply, just like the fact that that can exist and 
                    it can happen well, is a very nice thing about promise. </div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I plan to remain in academia.  I like teaching.  
                    I want to stay, you know, in a situation where I can do teaching. So, like, My career goal is to become 
                    a professor at a university or potentially teaching at high school, I personally would like prefer the 
                    university route, but, you know, depends on how things shake out. You know, I  
                    don't know that I have full control over that. I And yeah. So 
                    I guess if the question is, how does, how do you plan to use math as a math teacher that doesn't, yeah, 
                    yeah. But you know, like, hopefully I could create something 
                    that's actually useful to someone who, you know, who wants math more than just for the sheer pleasure 
                    of learning it, you know, like, hopefully I can help with something 
                    that has, you know, applications to some algorithm or something I don't know, I don't know that I really 
                    have full control over that either, but I don't know. It's just like math has been my passion and my hobby 
                    for my entire life, and I want to turn that into my career. </div>
