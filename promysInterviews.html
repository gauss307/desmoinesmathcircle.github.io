            <h2>Interviews at PROMYS 2024!</h2>
            <div class="author">Author: Maximillian Roach</div>
            <div class="date">August 4, 2024</div>
            <div class="pI-intro">
                <p>This summer I attended PROMYS (Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists) at Boston 
                University. The program places focus on number theory, and for many students it is 
                their first exposure to pure mathematics. Every morning, the entire program attends the 
                number theory lecture, taught by either Prof. Glenn Stevens or Prof. Henry Cohn. 
                First-year students typically put most of their effort into the number theory problem 
                set, whereas second-year students participate in advanced seminars. This year, the 
                advanced seminars were Galois Theory and Graph Theory. Interestingly, the problem sets 
                given each day are three days ahead of the lecture, and it is firmly emphasized that 
                students should not use the internet when p-setting (a term refering to working on your 
                problem set, and one that I have grown attached to). We are then able to more purely 
                explore fundamental concepts, perhaps reproducing the processes that brilliant 
                mathematicians went through to derive theorems and axioms. </p>

                <p>For me, PROMYS was a surprising experience because it was the first time I dealt
                with rigorous mathematics. 
                In the first week, we began by constructing an "inventory" for the set of integers. This is a 
                collection of axioms that describe the integers, distinguish them from other sets such 
                as the real numbers or Gaussian integers, and are needed to prove theorems about 
                integers. Examples of such axioms are the Distributive Property, existence of a zero
                element, and the Well Ordering Principle. I found it so difficult to come up with 
                axioms for my inventory because I have been dealing with integers since primary school. 
                How am I supposed to know the characteristics that are unique to integers? My peers and 
                and I had discovered that we had taken for granted many concepts that seemed to need no 
                explaining because we had been working with them for years. An especially humorous instance
                of this was on the midterm. A section on the test required absolute rigor, meaning you 
                have to cite all axioms you use and prove any theorems that are not given. There was a 
                certain problem that gave us trouble: Prove there exist no integers between 0 and 1. 
                This may seem trivial, but almost all first-years were baffled, me included, when we 
                received our test booklets to find a score of 5/12. The fatal mistake we had collectively made
                was forgetting to prove 0 < 1. Only 1 student in the program earned full points. </p>

                <p>Each student is assigned a counselor. The purpose of the counselors is to aid students in 
                learning the material and solving their problem sets, but never explicitely providing solutions.
                They are all extremely skilled in advanced mathematics and teaching others. 
                During my six weeks at PROMYS, I interviewed several counselors, hoping to gain insight on math
                beyond college and other related topics. </p>
                
                <p>The counselors I intereviewed are: </p>
