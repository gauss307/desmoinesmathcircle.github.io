            <h2>Interviews at PROMYS 2024!</h2>
            <div class="author">Author: Maximillian Roach</div>
            <div class="date">August 4, 2024</div>
            <div class="pI-intro">
                <p>This summer I attended PROMYS (Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists) at Boston 
                University. The program places focus on number theory, and for many students it is 
                their first exposure to pure mathematics. Every morning, the entire program attends the 
                number theory lecture, taught by either Prof. Glenn Stevens or Prof. Henry Cohn. 
                First-year students typically put most of their effort into the number theory problem 
                set, whereas second-year students participate in advanced seminars. This year, the 
                advanced seminars were Galois Theory and Graph Theory. Interestingly, the problem sets 
                given each day are three days ahead of the lecture, and it is firmly emphasized that 
                students should not use the internet when p-setting (a term refering to working on your 
                problem set, and one that I have grown attached to). We are then able to more purely 
                explore fundamental concepts, perhaps reproducing the processes that brilliant 
                mathematicians went through to derive theorems and axioms. </p>

                <p>For me, PROMYS was a surprising experience because it was the first time I dealt
                with rigorous mathematics. 
                In the first week, we began by constructing an "inventory" for the set of integers. This is a 
                collection of axioms that describe the integers, distinguish them from other sets such 
                as the real numbers or Gaussian integers, and are needed to prove theorems about 
                integers. Examples of such axioms are the Distributive Property, existence of a zero
                element, and the Well Ordering Principle. I found it so difficult to come up with 
                axioms for my inventory because I have been dealing with integers since primary school. 
                How am I supposed to know the characteristics that are unique to integers? My peers and 
                and I had discovered that we had taken for granted many concepts that seemed to need no 
                explaining because we had been working with them for years. An especially humorous instance
                of this was on the midterm. A section on the test required absolute rigor, meaning you 
                have to cite all axioms you use and prove any theorems that are not given. There was a 
                certain problem that gave us trouble: Prove there exist no integers between 0 and 1. 
                This may seem trivial, but almost all first-years were baffled, me included, when we 
                received our test booklets to find a score of 5/12. The fatal mistake we had collectively made
                was forgetting to prove 0 < 1. Only 1 student in the program earned full points. </p>

                <p>When I first arrived at PROMYS I found it very difficult to make friends. Everyone seemed to 
                have taken advanced pure math courses, qualified for olympiads, attended other prestigious math camps, 
                or were simply much smarter than me. Collaboration on p-sets is highly emphasized but after 
                the first week I pretty much barricaded myself in my room to work on math. I told myself that this 
                was because I didn't want other people spoiling things for me. I wanted to come across novel insights on 
                my own. Although this might have been true in some sense, it was more the case that I was afraid 
                that people would judge me when they discovered something and I had to keep asking questions 
                because I didn't understand. By the fourth week, I had begun counting down the days 
                until the end of the program, which would mark my return to the place and people I was accustomed to.
                But I eventually found the group of people I fit in with. For those last two weeks, we went to meals, 
                studied for finals, and attended minicourses together. On the day of departure, as the ranks of the 
                program began to slowly dwindle away, I was surprised to find myself tearing up while hugging and saying 
                goodbyes to friends as they left. It is undoubtable that the mathematics at PROMYS is amazing, but 
                the community there is its most valuable aspect. I discovered that the math community, with some exceptions,
                is not one that casts judgment upon you when you struggle with a concept. Instead, it is one that welcomes
                everyone who is passionate about learning and shares that certain indescribable characteristic everyone 
                interested in STEM seems to possess. 
                </p>

                <p>Each student is assigned a counselor. The purpose of the counselors is to aid students in 
                learning the material and solving their problem sets, but never explicitely providing solutions.
                They are all extremely skilled in advanced mathematics and teaching others. 
                During my six weeks at PROMYS, I interviewed several counselors, hoping to gain insight on math
                beyond college and other related topics. </p>
                
                <p>The counselors I intereviewed are: </p>

        <div id="Hari Iyer" class=" inter" style="display:none">
            <h2>Hari Iyer - Harvard</h2>
            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I didn't participate so much in competition math. I made it to the AIME. I did well
                on the AIME, but not enough to make the Olympiad. Other than that, I did the Ross program after my 
                sophomore year, and then I took many college classes at a nearby college, and I did some research with 
                a professor there.
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Oh that's such a hard question. I think most of the people who do well in college math and 
                research are not super competitive or deep into the math competition world. It depends on what you mean by 
                competition math. If it's people who are doing well, like locally, that's one thing. But there's a difference
                between people who make MOP and the people who win MOP. So the people who win everything are just generally 
                good at things, and they can do whatever they want, whatever they set their mind to. So I think in that sense, 
                there's a correlation at the very top. But it only goes one way. And that's because it's only a correlation. 
                There are so many other factors you can't really divorce from each other. Like, these people are already very 
                good. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I enjoy seeing people understand things. When someone gets something that I explained it
                feels good. Also, I enjoy explaining things that I'm interested in at the moment, because then it gives me a 
                reason to study it carefully. It helps me with my own work. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So far, I think I've been very fortunate. I have a frustrating moment that's not so much 
                frustrating. But when you leave college, I mean, I'm starting grad school in the fall, and you see all your
                friends making a lot more, like, a lot mroe money, and living a very nice lifestyle. You start to wonder 
                whether you should do that too. And a lot of people think about this a lot earlier, but I just happen to be
                a little late to the game. So I mean, I'm considering that there are a lot of things I didn't try when I was 
                in college, like I didn't intern anywhere. I just did research on the summers. The question is framed negatively,
                but I think doubt is a good thing. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I did some in high school. I reached out to a professor at my local university. I just showed
                him the stuff that I did at the Ross program, so then eh knew that I was, like, legit. And then this was very, very 
                lucky. He was just very gracious and happened to have something to think about, something very hands on.
                So we worked on that for a bit. I mean, it wasn't anything huge, but in college, I think this whole process is a lot 
                more structured and in some sense, less competitive. So in high school, there are maybe a few programs around the 
                country that formalize doig research for high school students. Like at PROMYS, there are some research labs, or there's 
                RSI, there's MIT PRIMES, things like that. But at the undergraduate level, the government proivdes a lot of funding for 
                REU programs. These are research experiences for undergraduates. These are scattered around the country, lots of 
                different subjects that you can choose, and I think many people also just opt to reach out to professors at their 
                schools and do that. There's also the world of industry research which I wish I'd explored more, but there's probably
                a lot more funding beind that too. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So this is my first year at PROMYS. I did the Ross program in hgih school which is very similar.
                As a student, I learned how to work, like a lot, and I learned why rigor is interesting or important or 
                even possible in the first place. A lot of people don't really think about rigor before they come to places like this, 
                very carefully. And it gives you, I guess, a slight edge in terms of just understanding formal arguments. As a counselor,
                you learn to read things very well. Like you learn to read your students' work carefully and efficiently, and you get a lot 
                better at spotting when there's an error, or on the other hand, when there's something interesting going on. 
                And you get faster. And I notice that when I try to read other things now I apply a similar critical viewpoint, and then that's 
                really nice as a counselor. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So I'm starting graduate school in the fall, planning to study number theory. I have a lot of time to 
                figure out what exactly I want to do, maybe stay in academia or research or something, if I'm good at it, and if I can make 
                enough money and live in a place I like. But other than that, I would consider, probably industry positions that are higher
                paying and well located. 
                </div>

            </div>
        </div>



        <div id="Angeline Peng" class=" inter" style="display:none">
            <h2>Angeline Peng - MIT</h2>
            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Um, so I went to a small charter school, and nobody at my school really did math, 
                    very seriously. Um, so I did, I did some competition math. I was never really that good, nor was 
                    I really motivated to get good. Because I had to go to another place to take the competition and 
                    I didn't know anybody who did it either. I'm from Singapore, and in Singapore, I also did math. 
                    There were more people doing math there. And when I moved to America, I kept doing math, but not 
                    as much anymore. So I applied to PROMYS , and I did the PROMYS application p-set and I was like, 
                    wow, this is so much fun. This is way better than competition math So I got into PROMYS as a 
                    rising junior And so I did PROMYS every year. I love PROMYS . So that's like, the main thing 
                    I did in high school. I didn't really find the motivation to do a lot of competition or, like, 
                    math in general during the school year, so I really just, like, worked on my classes and stuff. </div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">, Yeah, um, I think the correlation is it exists. I think if you're good at 
                    competition math, you do have the skills like, that helps you be good at higher math, 
                    but it's like, very different. You can do very, very well at competitions, like, IMO, gold medalists 
                    but that doesn't mean you're guaranteed to do well on like, I know an gold medalist who got a B or a C 
                    on an algebra test, right? So it's like, it definitely helps. Like these kids, they pick up things 
                    pretty fast. I definitely have like, I feel like I spend more time doing readings and stuff compared 
                    to them, so they're really quick. But I feel like math, like higher level math, is a lot of like, you 
                    just keep working at it. And like, you just keep thinking about it and just working with examples. 
                    And like, the more intuition you build, the more experience you build with it. It just translates to 
                    being better at math, right? That being said, it definitely helps to be good in a competition math, 
                    but it's different. You have to like also put in the time. </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">um, I don't know. I think mainly because when I was, like, early on in high school, I didn't 
                    like math a lot because I was not good at competition math. So I hated that. so I like and then I feel like 
                    worrying about competition math Like, the thing with comp math is you need to, get the quick insight a lot 
                    of the times. And I just didnt get it um, but there's, like, a still, a lot of cool things about math. And 
                    like, when I hear people talk about, like, not liking math, it's like you just haven't seen a lot of math. 
                    It's like the wrong impression. And I, like, do want to expose people to like that kind of math first before 
                    they make judgments about whether or not they want to do math. But like, I feel like so many people miss out, 
                    like I'm talking like generic maybe not like math math people, but like, generic people. Like, they hate math 
                    because they think it's just computation. There's, like, so much more to it. But yeah, like, I guess it's 
                    because it's, I like math, and I think people have the wrong impression about it. You know, you just want 
                    to correct that.</div>

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Oh, I mean, so many, so many, like, even when you're solving problems and you don't 
                    really get it, like, that's always really bad. What helps me? Perhaps it's like, not really the most. 
                    It's not healthy. But like, I just go, I'm not a quitter, and I can't have people know that I'm a 
                    quitter. You know, it's like, it's like, how you go on a run with someone else and you both, like, 
                    run further, because you guys, like, mutually, don't want to be the first one to stop. That's like, 
                    that's, that's the thing I love. Yeah, I mean, like, there was, there was one piece set, I remember 
                    in my college that was really bad, and, like, a lot of people dropped the class because of that p-set. 
                    But then I was like, I'm not a quitter. I cannot live this down if, I don't do it. And then, you know, 
                    like, I think, especially when you're young, it's easy to think, I can't do this immediately, I can 
                    never do it. But like, you'll be so surprised by like, you just keep working at it. It like, falls 
                    into place. And also, it's like, okay to ask people for help. And like, you understand it later.</div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I guess my main experience with research was at promise when I was a student, I actually 
                    didn't like doing research labs, because it was very I wasn't very into the topic, like, I think there's 
                    very limited math that you can do when you are when you don't know that much math. A lot of math research 
                    requires, like having the foundation. So I didn't like it. I didn't like the math I was working with, 
                    because a lot of it is, like combo problems here, like, bounding, oh my god, bounding is so un fun. So yeah, 
                    I don't I didn't like it that much. But also, like, I'm excited to do research, like, this coming year, when 
                    I have more background and I can do more work into the stuff that I'm interested in. But like, it's really 
                    a lot of, like, you get a problem, and you just sit and play with it for a while, and you ask questions 
                    about it, and like, oh no. Like, how you approach a PROMYS problem, but like, a very long term skill. And, 
                    yeah, it's also nothing more interested in. My research lab was actually a lot, was actually quite 
                    interesting, and I might think about it more sometime in the future. TM, I'll get back to it. But, 
                    like, I don't know, like, after a while, if the problem isn't something that interests you on a deep 
                    level, you really do get bored of it because you think about it for such a long time, and this is also 
                    my issue, because I get bored of problems pretty quickly. Yeah, I like certain kinds of math, and it wasn't 
                    really that. </div>

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Oh, um, just knowing what pure math really looks like. Because everybody really knows 
                    what competition math looks like, and that's pure math is nowhere like that. And I think math is, like, 
                    really cool. I mean, promise has changed me a lot in the sense that, like I used to not like math, 
                    and then now I really do like math, but, yeah, you find a new way of doing math, and also how to 
                    approach problem solving. I think it helps with math in general, and this is like jump started at 
                    PROMYS But like, as I'm working through math, I learned that, like, a lot of problems, like, if you 
                    just put time and effort into it, and your progress is definitely not linear. Like, it's not clear 
                    that you're getting closer to your to, like, solving the problem, because you're still stuck on the 
                    problem, and then, like, sudden, suddenly you're unstuck, because a lot of the growth is hidden that 
                    you make when you do math. And so, like, after doing promise, like having this experience, and like, 
                    I learned so much math every year during promise, and like, the maturity that you give for it's so so 
                    much, like, I definitely believe way more in, like, hidden progress. And like, any work you do is good 
                    work, even if it's not getting anywhere.</div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Yeah, I'm not really sure what I'm gonna do. Career wise, money is great and academia is 
                    hard to get good sources of money, good or even consistent sources of money. Um I mean, I think I'm treating 
                    math more as like, like right now I'm majoring in it, and it's like, if I'm gonna work in something, 
                    then math is like, gonna be my hobby more than something that's I'm directly gonna use in my job. But 
                    like, as I said earlier, I learned a lot of life lessons from doing math, and so I think that's, like, 
                    very important. But I'm also, like, maybe going to academia, because I really enjoy teaching. So like, 
                    if I go into academia, I can very directly apply the math that I know into that, but, like, I'm definitely 
                    not going to need that if I'm going to go into, like, coding or CS or something like that.</div>
                
                    <div class="question">how does advanced math differ from math like most people are accustomed to 
                        learning in high school?
                    </div>
                    <div class="answer">Yeah, I think math in high school, okay, in high school, it's very formulaic, and you 
                        can, like, lay out all the steps you do, or, like, there's a way to make it very formulaic. And I 
                        think that was what I found like school, grade school math to be. And I think math is. you know what? 
                        Like, I think it's fair that people don't like math because math is difficult and like, but like, 
                        we shouldn't not like something because it's difficult. But that's like, that's not the mentality to 
                        lead life with, um, pure math is very It's very pretty. I think in school, it focuses a lot on the 
                        computational aspects, but not very much on the prettiness, or, I don't know, it really like, doesn't 
                        give you time to explore. And I think, like, math is a lot, a lot of it, a lot of getting results. 
                        And this is what my algebra professor said about research. It's like, you don't really pick a problem 
                        and then solve the problem. More often than not. When you're doing research, you pick an object of 
                        study, like, I'm gonna study this specific group, I'm gonna study this specific like thing in math, 
                        and then you study, you understand it a lot, and when you do that, results pop out. With math in 
                        school, the emphasis is on getting the problem solved. Math is, you get an object and you you study 
                        it, and then results pop out from studying. It's about it's about the journey not the destination. 
                        That's what math is in the end. And yeah, and it's dumb that, like, yeah, they don't really talk about 
                        the journey. They just care about the destination. And to be fair, it's all the kids fault anyways, 
                        because they're like, oh, teacher, when am I ever gonna need this in my life? And then the teacher 
                        gives them a problem where they need to apply in their real life, and then they cry about it.</div>

            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">In middle school I started doing a lot of competition math. In high 
                    school I continued doing so and I was very engaged, and that was probably the thing
                     that took up most of my time outside of school. I stopped being so engaged after, 
                     say, junior year of high school, but I guess after my 10th grade, I went to promise, 
                     which where I am now, and I went back to promise for the summer after end of the 
                     summer after my senior year. So I went back three years, and I think that was a very 
                     good exposure to what math is like in college and beyond.I think the main place where I had social capital in, you know, my old middle and high school was 
                     from me being smart. I was the person that people could ask me for, like, homework help. 
                     I could be the person that, like, they asked me to, like, you know, like test answers or 
                     whatever, that I could be, the person that they could rely on to, you know, do well in 
                     my competitions or whatnot. And I think having the opportunity to engage with people who 
                     had similar interests to me, and who I could talk about math with, and who I could just 
                     interact with without being so self conscious about, like, what I provide to others and 
                     how others perceive me was very, was just, was very refreshing. And although a lot of 
                     these people weren't from my area, I talked a lot with them, like, online, and I'm beat 
                     up with them, like, whenever we go to, like state competitions, and like, when we travel 
                     to like natural competitions. And so having that kind of friendship, and a lot of people,
                      I, like, a lot of people from there, I actually like, very close with now, like, for 
                      example, one of my closest friends from from North Carolina starting middle school. 
                      We actually had dinner yesterday because he's like, he's around because he goes to MIT, 
                      and so having that community was was was very solid for my upbringing.</div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer"> I think there is very little correlation. In fact, there might be negative 
                    correlation. The reason being is that I think if you do a lot of competition math, you gain 
                    the impression that you're very good at math. And so I guess I'm, like, speaking for myself. 
                    So this is all from like, the i perspective. But once I got into college, I realized that there 
                    are a lot of people who had much great, much greater exposure to college math than I had, and I 
                    thought I had a good amount, because I went to promise for three years, and I felt like a lot 
                    of people who went to promise before me, and who went to like these, took to college, you 
                    know, Excel very well in terms of math. But I went there and I was, I suddenly felt very 
                    behind. And a lot of these people had many, many years of just like, I don't know, like studying 
                    group theory or studying, like linear algebra before me. Like even some some high schools like, 
                    offer these classes, like in, like, at their high school, it's just like, if you've already taken 
                    these classes before, like, how am I supposed to like, how am I supposed to compete with that? 
                    And I think competition math is teaches you a lot of math, but it is not the same kind of skill 
                    set as pure math in a lot of ways. I think there's some intersect. Gym, perhaps, and like some 
                    niche fields, but I think generally, pure math likes to the most important thing of pure math is 
                    like, is language which is very which is something that, like Glenn always talks about you want, 
                    you want to express your like, a certain idea, and so you try to, like, formulate the proper 
                    like definitions and the proper language in order to express that idea. And then you develop the 
                    idea, like, very abstractly from the ground up. Whereas in competition math is you have these, 
                    like, these tools in place already. So you're not generating anything new, but you're like, 
                    applying like that, that the novelty in competition math is you're taking these ideas and 
                    you're trying to apply it. You're trying to, like, combine them in, like, a more creative way. 
                    And so there's, like, a small subtlety there, but it's, I think it's like, it's very profoundly 
                    different, like, they're very fundamentally different. And I think, for example, like the way of 
                    thinking for competition, math, maybe more in line with, say, I don't know, like, like, computer 
                    science or something, or you have these, like, these algorithms in place, and you're, like, aware 
                    of these algorithms. And the question is not, like, how can I, I don't know, construct a new I mean,
                     like, research, of course, like, exists in these areas, but especially like, within, like, the college 
                     classroom setting, it's not like, how can like, construct these like, new things, but like, rather, 
                     okay, I've like, learned this algorithm now. How can I apply it to these problems in like, very, very 
                     unique ways? So yeah, I think actually, a lot of my competition friends end up not staying in pure math. 
                     And the people who do stay in pure math are the ones who, the vast majority of them are the ones who had a 
                     lot of, like, more pure math experience when they were in high school, which makes sense, like, if you 
                     studied a lot of like, a certain subject in high school, and you're, like, bound to study it more in 
                     college. It's just that I think competition math should not be equated to peer math. And so, like, 
                     if you see them as, like, two different subjects, and it makes complete sense, like, you study to say 
                     one thing, and you're trying to, like, study this other thing, which is, like, very different from what 
                     you just studied. And so it's like these things, like, won't translate. And a lot of people like, they 
                     think that it's like, the same thing. Or me, I thought it was the same thing, and then I, you know, 
                     I went in with this, like, this idea that I could, just, like, you know, do well, and then it didn't 
                     turn out that way. 
                </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I think math can be such. It's designed so precisely that in a lot of instances I 
                    think it's just difficult to not teach it in a compelling way. Like so many things in math, are 
                    interesting. So as long as like, you are able to convey this excitement to your students, then it 
                    can be like, extremely, extremely eye opening. I'm sure this is true for like, other subjects, but 
                    I think let's say the ideas that you find in math and, like, the the way the subject has been 
                    developed for such a long time, there's, like, so much richness to it. And, you know, teaching 
                    someone, you know, a really slick proof, or, like, a really, like full result, which, like, comes 
                    out of nowhere. It's just, it's just, like, so, so exciting. </div>

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I guess the most memorable time was like after, after freshman year. So at the end 
                    of my my freshman year, I got kicked out of college because of covid, or like we all got kicked out 
                    of not just like I had a singularly kicked out of college. We all were forced to move off campus 
                    because of covid. And during covid, I decided to take a break from from particularly math, or it 
                    wasn't even particularly math. I just, like, wanted to explore everything I was interested in to 
                    see whether or not, like, I really wanted to do math in the first place, because I felt like in 
                    my freshman year, I'd taken a lot of these, like required classes that are needed to take other 
                    more advanced classes. Is in, in the STEM area. So I took, like, you know, the intro statistics 
                    series, the intro computer science sequence. Took like, you know, the intro, like, the math class 
                    that freshman people take. And I don't know, I didn't feel very particularly attached to any of 
                    them, whereas, like, a lot of my friends were like, Oh, this class is, like, extremely interesting 
                    when I want to, like, continue pursuing this or, like, Oh, I've already, like, found a lab to, like, 
                    do research, like, alongside the topic of, like, this class and, like, I didn't feel the same 
                    conviction towards anything. So I was like, Okay, we're in this pandemic right now. I don't really 
                    want to take online classes. A lot of classes I want to take, I don't think would like, translate 
                    well into an online setting. Like, for example, I was interested in, like, exploring interested in, 
                    like, exploring music, music. Like, online classes for music is just like, I think it's like, 
                    terrible, that's stupid. And so I decided to take a gap year and a legal absence and just explore 
                    everything that I wanted to do. And this was very refreshing. Like, at the end of the day, I I kept 
                    close track of my time with the philosophy that, like, Okay, I would not give myself any any, like, 
                    super hard of responsibilities, but I would just explore. I would just like do what I want to do, 
                    and I keep track of my time. So I, like, had this whole spreadsheet, and I would like keep track of 
                    my time, like, what I did, like every like, every 30 minutes of the day, and then this is just, 
                    like, very, just like, very clear and very raw data of like, what I want to do. And I my belief was 
                    that once I looked at the spreadsheet and I saw, like, what I invested my time in the most, that's 
                    the thing that I should be doing, because that's the thing I'm, like, inclined to do, and very 
                    shockingly, or like, maybe not shockingly at that time, but like, math is definitely not up in 
                    that list, and it was a lot of, like, non stem stuff, and that got me very confused for a very long 
                    time. So then when I came back sophomore year, I decided to take a lot of these classes, and, like 
                    these, these humanities fields, and, yeah, they were, some of the classes kind of let me down, but 
                    a lot of them were, like, very, very good and, you know, very thought provoking. And I was engaging 
                    in these classes, like, a lot more than I was doing, like the math classes I was taking, just like 
                    with all my requirements, and so I was very seriously thinking about, like, putting math altogether, 
                    like once I got into my sophomore year. But I think the big turning point for me was actually, 
                    like coming back to promise as a counselor, because after like, talking with some people here, I 
                    realized that maybe, like, my frustration with math was not because, like, I was disengaged with it, 
                    but because I, like, didn't see the I didn't see the bigger, the greater vision of, like, why to 
                    study math? I guess, like, when you're taking because math like you there, like, so many like, 
                    prerequisites that you need to fulfill in order to, like, get to classes that are interesting. All 
                    the undergrad classes are like, you take these classes so you can understand, like, these graduate 
                    level classes, and do these graduate level classes so you're able to understand, like, I don't know, 
                    these like advanced, like grad topics courses. And then from there you can, like, choose your research 
                    topic and like, go forward. Like, this is not the same for biology? For like, biology, you can, like, 
                    take it intro class and find a question that interests you, and you like, go into they can, like, 
                    join a research lab, which, like many people do, and they just like working on lab, like all of your 
                    undergrad and like, you like, know what the problems are, and you like, know what the motivation is 
                    like for math, this is, like, very obscure, like, spend a lot of time in order to even understand what, 
                    like, the big research questions are in your field. So I just, like, didn't see that big picture. But 
                    like, very just, like, I think the timing was just really right, because I learned enough math to kind 
                    of like, be able to understand the bigger picture at like, a very high level. But it was like, I didn't 
                    understand enough. So it was, like, very intriguing to me. And like, through talking with other counselors, 
                    like, going to counsel seminars and stuff, I like, realized I was able to, like, see, oh, this is like, 
                    why these things are so important. This is like, why this subject is, like, you teach at such, like, 
                    such early on your curriculum, like, I don't understand for saying, like, gawa theory was so important. 
                    Like, it's just you're taking, like, I don't know, it seemed like so stupid to me. It was like, this has 
                    no application. Like, it's just so random. But in fact, like, it's one of the most fundamental things 
                    that comes up in like, many areas of math. And just seeing this kind of, like, this motivation for all
                     these things was like, Okay, maybe like, yeah, now I have, like, greater motivation. And now I have, 
                     like, now I know, like, where I'm going, like, moving forward. Like, now I have something like, I want 
                     to I want to reach, and some topic I want to study. And that was like, I think that really, like, shifted 
                     my perspective on math. I still have qualms now of whether or not I should, like, stay in, stay in STEM 
                     I don't know like. Like, pure math. You know, the like, job prospects are pretty low. I've done, like, 
                     outside of promise. I've done this actual math research once, and it was, like, pretty difficult for me. 
                     And so I still not convinced that, like, math academia is the right space for me. But at the time being, 
                     is like the thing that like, I enjoy very much, and so I'm I'm sticking with it. </div>
                
                <div class="question">What would you reccomend to someone who is interested in math but is having difficulty
                    finding ways to explore that interest?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Don't be like, discouraged. Don't be discouraged if you, like, don't understand something, 
                    because it's like, like, learning about this very hard, and it's very, very rare to understand things for 
                    the first time. And so I think, like, people come in with the expectation that, like, you know you should 
                    understand that the first time around, and that you don't. And it's very discouraging. Thank you. And so 
                    if you just take the if you really are interested in math, then you should, like, figure out, like, you 
                    know, maybe, like, here around, you know, certain things that, like people keep talking about, and then 
                    you go and try to study those things, and then if you don't understand it, that just like, leave it and 
                    like, revisit it later. Like, if someone is interested in studying math, and like, the motivations that 
                    motivation is already there, which is, like, a great thing. I would also encourage people to, like, you 
                    know, do competition math, as long as you have, like, a healthy relationship towards it, which I guess 
                    I talked about in my panel, in our panel, yes, but yeah, I think you should explore things that, like, 
                    what helped me in college was like, I started to just study things when I thought it was important to me 
                    and like, I was very, like, there was a very like, strong reason for me to study it. And this just comes 
                    from like, studying things like, just in depth, like, once, like studies, like, once you like, learn enough 
                    things, and like, natural questions will arise, and you're like, oh, like, this thing keeps coming up over 
                    and over again. Like, this issue, like, I'm like, bothered with, like, over and over again, and then you 
                    try to, like, address it. So, like, you study things when it comes out of necessity. Um, I think that's 
                    like, the most impactful way, and, like, the most efficient way to learn, like, previously, I would try to 
                    learn things where, like, oh, like, I don't know, Frank was a good example. Like, oh, I'm taking this class 
                    next semester. I don't really know much about it, but a lot of my friends are taking it, and I want to 
                    prepare beforehand. So I'm going to, like, read the first few pages of the textbook. That's like, textbook. 
                    That's like, you know, I relate it to this class. I can get a head start. That's like, a pretty good, 
                    pretty good motivation. Like, that's a pretty good reason to study, but I don't think it's like a strong 
                    reason, and that, like, can lead to like discouragement a lot of cases. So I think, like, you should think 
                    about why you want to study math. And, like, have a strong conviction for it before you study math. I think 
                    this is true for everything. Just be, like, very mindful of what you want to study and why you want to study 
                    it. And if you think your reasons comply, compelling enough anything like what you should do, like that 
                    answer should just like, arise. Is, or it might not be, like, important at all. Like, if your motivation is 
                    strong enough, then, like, Whatever you do to study, like, whether you just say, search up on the internet 
                    to, like, find, find some find some resources. Like, ask some people around you, I think like anything will 
                    be pretty fulfilling.</div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">so I guess I did math research in promise for two years, and that was, I mean, like, back 
                    then, I didn't know anything, so it was a bit difficult to do, like, make any progress. But I think thinking 
                    about questions that you that you know, like no one has really, you know, no one really knows the answers 
                    to, was was extremely cool and extremely novel thing. At the same time, I knew that the advisors, right, 
                    the people who proposed the projects, already had like an outline in mind, and so it was just like we were 
                    just trying to chase that idea. And so it felt both very novel, but at the same time very just like we're 
                    basically just doing like, someone else's work that, like they already, like, kind of know what to do, but 
                    they're just like, letting students do it, which I think is like a great, like a great thing, but it wasn't 
                    like all, you know, like all shining stars or whatever, like I did math research at a REU, like a research 
                    experience for undergrads program last year, and that was, I mean, he the our mentor. I worked with a one 
                    other person who was actually, who actually went to promise in 2019, and 2021, or and 2020, yeah, 19 and 20 
                    he, I say, Yeah, I was working with him. And then our mentors, they proposed this project, and they build 
                    it as, like, you know, being accessible, and like, you know, undergrads, they would be able to understand it. 
                    And I had taken like, several, like grad courses at a time to say, okay, like this. This should be manageable, 
                    but then, yeah, it was just like, hard swinging out the gate, you know, very, just like, very, very deep 
                    into the deep into the details, I guess, yeah, and I personally, like, found it pretty hard to follow along, 
                    let alone like, contribute any like, any ideas on my own. But it gave me a taste of what like, actual like 
                    if I were to become, you know, like a kind of postdoc somewhere, like a, you know, grad student, like what 
                    math research would look like, and it, I think, like, maybe the project wasn't the best fit for me, slash, 
                    like, I wasn't prepared for it enough. But, yeah, I'm still, like, trying to, I'm still trying to think about 
                    the like, my experience more. And I guess I'm still working on the project, so it's like, I'm still, like, 
                    very frustrated by it, but yeah, I think, like, I don't know, I think that the TLDR is like, I was not 
                    prepared for the project, and I'm still trying to prepare for it right now, like, trying to, like, gain, 
                    not only like the necessary background, But the necessary intuition, or to, like, move forward. But I 
                    think like, for if you're, like, working on a project, and you have this kind of intuition, and this kind 
                    of, like, you see a problem, and like, you don't really know what to do, but like, you have this like, gut 
                    feeling of what like things should look like and how things should arise, then it becomes very interesting. 
                    And this was, there's one point in the project where I was doing this, like, this smaller problem, and I did 
                    get this feeling, and it was very, like, very satisfying. Was either you, like, you keep doing it and your 
                    gut feeling is right, and you're like, wow, like, things turned out like the way I expected, in this really 
                    nice way, or like, things don't turn out the way that that you expect, which is very frustrating. At the 
                    same time, it's like, oh, then there's something like, interesting going on here. Like, what is going on y
                    ou like, pursue that. I can't really say much about, like, other fields of other fields of research, but at 
                    least my impression in math, at least, like the things I study in classes, slash like this project, is that 
                    a lot of the a lot of math research can be very distilled. It's, you know, you do like these may just like 
                    proof that contains, like, you know, say five pages of just say one proof for like, one theorem. Or you have 
                    like, all these definitions, and then you set up this like lemma, and then you prove this theorem. But like, 
                    it's, you're able, at the end of the day, you're able to, like, distill all these ideas, it's like, in this 
                    five page proof, like, you can identify, usually, like, at max, like, three, like, usually, like two things 
                    which are like. Would you make this proof work? And the rest is just like filling into details and like 
                    understanding, like, what is it necessary for this proof to work? Like understanding, like the big moves, 
                    like, within, like, each step of your research, like, then things like, it very much. Then things are very 
                    illuminated, I guess. In contrast, for instance, like I did after my freshman year, I did this, like 
                    quantitative social science research. It's basically like statistics for what the frick is. It called, oh my 
                    gosh, I'm forgetting my entire research project. It was on differential privacy. That's what it was. It's 
                    like, you have this like database, and then you're trying to, you want to be able to access all like the 
                    statistical like, all the relevant statistical values, like the mean, the standard deviation, whatever. But 
                    you don't want each row to be like, traced back, like, you don't want any like, anyone's identity to be 
                    revealed. And so the idea is that you add a bunch of random noise, and it's like, well, how much does like, 
                    how much bias is there on, like, the statistic, statistical estimates, and how can I correct this bias? The 
                    idea, like, the problem can be like, easily stated. You know, it's like, you can understand the project, but 
                    I felt like that during the whole time I was just doing a bunch of these computations that, like, didn't 
                    really have any motivation, and you're just like, making these estimates. And that was not very, like, not 
                    super satisfying to me, because there was, like, no bigger picture. Just like, Oh, you're just like, 
                    fidgeting with numbers to make things work. Like, to me, that isn't like, that isn't really math, that's 
                    just computation. I think those are two different things. </div>

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I guess the mantra a promise is to think deeply as simple things. And I forget to 
                    do it a lot, but I think it's a very important thing to do. Thank you. I You, especially in math, 
                    but also, like in other fields. Yeah, I think it's a very like, I've been very influential, like, 
                    in the ways that like I go about I don't know, like, reflection of myself, like thinking about like,
                    what I want, like, what I want to do, and like what's best for me. That's like, if you, if you think 
                    hard enough about like, certain ideas, then like, you'll be able to distill it into like, I don't know, 
                    to like, a spare, like, essentials, let's say, like, say you come up with a problem like, Oh, I'm 
                    feeling down right now, right, but I don't really know why I'm feeling kind of down. Then you think 
                    about, like, okay, what are the possible things that was, like, making me feel sad, like, and then 
                    this, like, leads on. And then the more you think about this, I think, like, the true underpinnings, 
                    like, will come up. And so, yeah, there's a whole framework about just, like, really, like, the 
                    largest amount of information and a thing that really like affects everything comes from, like, 
                    the simplest ideas is like a super important, super important framework. I I will say that I like, 
                    spent too long trying to like I don't know, in a way, like axiomatizing my life. I like, I was such 
                    a believer of the promised experience. Like, I thought that I could create, like, an inventory of, 
                    like, how I should act, like, kind of like a inventory for my morality, and then that could dictate
                    how I do everything. I was very insistent on, like, making this possible. But I think such a thing is 
                    very, very unreasonable, but if you're not so, like, hard, driven. On, 
                    like, making everything like, super precise. Then, like, if you think about 
                    things like deeply enough, then like, you can get your understanding about yourself and like about 
                    your surroundings.</div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I'll just keep studying it until I don't enjoy it anymore, in which case, I'll, like, 
                    stop doing math. I think that's like, my, my general philosophy with, like, what I do is just, I'll 
                    keep doing it until I don't enjoy it, and then I do something else. Yeah, maybe this is like, very 
                    not, um, not responsible me, but I don't know. I feel like it's like, difficult to plan things like, 
                    so far ahead. Like, if I don't really know like, because you like, stuff changes so quickly, like me, 
                    like, next month will be very different from me now, right? So it's, I think, like planning to precisely 
                    like what I'm going to do is like, kind of, kind of difficult, but her time being is like, I'll do 
                    next year, doing a master's program, and then I'm going to do, like, a PhD program in math. Where are 
                    you going for my master's? I'm going to Sorbonne in Paris, and then I'm applying to PhD programs next 
                    year. So, but I'll, I'm applying to only PhD programs in the US. So if I do go to PhD, I'll go back to 
                    the US. But, yeah, we'll see where life takes me. I don't know that's many, many opportunities I.

                <div class="answer">Okay, I didn't do any competition math. I tried it in middle school. I didn't really 
                    like it. Math counts. Or what did you do in middle school? I 
                    don't remember. It was in sixth grade. In high school, my 
                    situation was pretty unique. In my freshman year, I did AP Calc because I had already 
                    been taking high school courses during middle school, and then in the middle of my sophomore year, 
                    I was taking BC Calc. But then a lot of stuff happened, and I ended 
                    up changing schools to, like, this thing called the Met school in Providence. It's like, I don't know, 
                    very non traditional, like project based learning all of this stuff. And there were a lot of reasons 
                    for that, but one of them was just that I was out of math programs at my old public school. Another was 
                    just that, like I was kind of not doing well in non math courses. I don't even know how to describe it. 
                    It's a long time ago. Whatever. I don't need to get into it. It's not about math. But at any rate, I 
                    finished taking BC calc did well on both of the exams, and then I my dad was teaching
                     at Brown at the time during my junior year, he was anyway, so then I was auditing some 
                     classes at Brown University, and I also did that my senior year, and that was, like, my first, like, 
                     real, real exposure to, like, pure proof based math and, like, I really liked it. And also because, 
                     like, the med school was, like, this project based thing, I was also supposed to do an internship, and 
                     I ended up doing a computer science internship. I'm no longer in computer science, but I did that during 
                     my senior year, and I was also taking more math classes. And after I finished, because, like, my high 
                     school experience was kind of like Rocky, I decided that before I went to college, I wanted to take a 
                     gap year, and I just continued my internship in Boston until then. Then the pandemic happened. Then I 
                     went into southern Connecticut because it was close to our house. And then I went to Boston University</div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Um, I think something that I really like about math and specific, specifically about 
                    talking about math, is there are a lot of different ways to express the same concept a lot of the time,
                     and like teaching it in and of itself, and thinking of how it should be taught, can help, like reframe 
                     your own conception of what kind of thing, the thing you're trying to teach is, and teaching someone 
                     and like answering their questions and thinking about like how best to represent something is also 
                     just a fun exercise for me. </div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I did do research? It was at summary in 2022 it was an REU at Yale, and 
                    our group was looking at hyperbolic topology. Specifically we were we were supposed to find the minimal 
                    spanning surface of the ideal octahedron, which sounds intimidating, but it's essentially finding, like, 
                    you have the shape in hyperbolic space that looks kind of like an octahedron, except it's like, kind of 
                    curved, and its point goes points goes out to infinity, because that's something that happens. And then 
                    you want to, like, cut it in two, and you want to find the, like, smallest area of the hexagon that cussed 
                    it too. Anyway, the problem with it was, I think it was just kind of a poorly picked problem, because 
                    if we didn't have, like, a background in hyperbolic topology or hyperbolic geometry, sorry, like, we 
                    kind of learned it like over the course of the thing. Like, we learned some stuff, but not enough to 
                    tackle this unsolved problem. And what we ended up doing was, instead of, like, tackling it from like, 
                    a more conceptual, proof based standpoint, we kind of just brute forced what like this hexagon should 
                    look like, using simulations, we wrote like we just did a lot of formulas, did a bunch of calculus, 
                    and made a regression that should simulate what it is. It was still like cool to work on, but I feel 
                    like it wasn't a full research experience. I also, like, I went to Isaac's talk about sphere packing, 
                    and I feel like that's something that's probably a lot easier to approach than something like hyperbolic 
                    geometry. But I guess I just, I hope I get another chance in the future, but it was still fun. </div>

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">Well, okay, so I was there in 23 and I felt last year like it was still 
                    really rewarding, because, like, I just enjoyed teaching. Like, if summary was my first 
                    exposure to research. This was my first, like, real exposure to teaching. And I definitely enjoyed that. 
                    It was a lot of work. I also did not know almost any number theory, like, I had taken a group theory 
                    course that covered some of it, but there was still, like, a lot of new ground. And I felt like, sorry, 
                    I'm kind of just rambling, describing my what was like, the like question about,
                    like, what you need understanding. Okay, yeah, so I feel like last 
                    time I was kind of more reclusive. I didn't really go to talks. I just did grading because I was 
                    struggling to keep up with the number theory myself. And I still think that was, like, a really valuable 
                    experience for me, because I just hadn't done something like that before. And this year, it's still hard 
                    for me, I think, to like, attend all these talks, because the counselor seminars is legitimately absurd. 
                    So I have, like, no idea what the counselor seminars are like or how often they're 
                    there were five today. That's each of them an hour, a lot of the time they go over. 
                    So are they as structured as, like the mini courses? It's hopefully, yeah, that's kind of 
                    impressive. Yeah, I can't do it. I haven't done it anyway. Yeah, I think 
                    this year I've definitely been like pushing myself to try to experience more new math. And I've also realized 
                    that specifically, this format of counselor seminars just hasn't really worked for me. And there have been a 
                    couple other things that the counselors did that has worked. And we were actually talking about this today, 
                    and we're going to try some other stuff. But I think, like, more effective ways of learning this stuff for 
                    me would be like more informal discussions and things like that, and like watching a video together and 
                    trying to understand it, or reading something together and trying to understand it. But anyway, I'm kind 
                    of rambling. All in all, it's been a very valuable experience. </div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">So I may have mentioned this before, maybe I didn't, but I was actually a double major in 
                    math and Japanese, um, and, like, I've always been interested in math from, like, when I was, like, really 
                    little kid, and like, when I started bu i was probably going to do like, math and CS, and then I did, 
                    like, Japanese language credits. I really liked it. I started doing it more. One thing led to another, 
                    and here I am. So now I'm in this situation where a lot of my hobbies and things I do in my free time are 
                    like related to Japanese, like, things like the visual novels I read, the games I play the like fighting 
                    game players I talk to even. But the math is something that I don't really do in my free time as much and 
                    something that I probably should be doing more. But My reasoning for going to grad school and math, because, 
                    like, I really like both I could envision myself doing either like math or like Japanese translation as a 
                    career is, I think if I like did Japanese as a career, then I probably just wouldn't do math as a hobby. 
                    And it feels like I'm keeping more of a nice balance for myself, if I have math as a career and then 
                    Japanese as a hobby, but it's still going to be hard to balance. And anyway, in terms of the math question 
                    itself, I'm going to this master's program, and then I'm going to go to a PhD. Most likely  
                    would you be interested academia? Or do you like, most likely academia, because so far, 
                    like, my favorite experience with math has been teaching, but it's all still very up in the air, even though 
                    I've I'm a graduate student now, so don't be scared if you can't make a  decision. How do you 
                    think advanced math differs from math like most people are accustomed to learning in high school, and just 
                    to like, preface, I don't know it's kind of complicated, because I like created the math circles mostly for, 
                    like, middle school students. But obviously that's like, not the whole thing, but I think it's like, a lot 
                    of is, like, people that, like, don't really have an idea of what, like, computer math is. Like, um,  
                    sorry, Math Circle. Oh, this is, like, the club you're a part of. Like, I founded, like, 
                    my city's MATH CIRCLE. Okay, that's really cool. Yeah, I honestly, because of like, how 
                    revolutionary, like learning, like group theory was in my what was it would have been 
                    junior year, I think Junior, it should have been Junior, yeah, Junior, like that was just like mind blowing to me. 
                    I personally think, like the lack of proof based math in grade school is just kind of tragic. Like, you 
                    have geometry even, like, and then everyone hates geometry. Yeah, 
                    everyone hates geometry. And, like, you don't get to see a lot of the really cool proofs. It's just like, 
                    putting things in an order and knowing the definitions. And granted, there are fair number of groups like 
                    that, but yeah, that just isn't like even around my dad, I felt like I wasn't really exposed to something 
                    that required rigor until I started taking university classes. I. Yeah. So yeah, that's like, Sorry, could 
                    you repeat the question? How does it like advanced math differ from math? Most people, yeah, 
                    okay, I guess I kind of answered that in my rambling, but just the existence of rigor and 
                    proofs and, like, honestly, just like an appreciation of math for math sake. Like some proofs are just 
                    really cool, and I think people should see them, and that'd be awesome.</div>

            <h2>Akiva Weinberger - Yale</h2>
            <div class="QA">

                <div class="question">What was your experience with math 
                    during high school? If you participated in competition
                    math, please also speak on that.
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I did not participate in competition math, but I I had, let's say, a very privileged 
                    math upbringing. I my parents realized that I was really a fan of the stuff since I was a very little 
                    kid, and my dad bought me tons and tons of math books ever since I was like seven, and I'm immensely 
                    grateful for that. But what that meant was that by the time I entered high school, I actually knew a 
                    lot more math than most of my peers, so the school agreed to do a special thing where I would have 
                    one on one classes with the physics teacher, Mr. Klotz, who would like just the two of us do a math 
                    class, and he would teach me things like multivariable calculus and linear algebra and differential 
                    equations and sort of, I think the last year or the second to last year of high school, he said to me, 
                    Hey, I remember you saying that you didn't feel as strong in geometry. So I got this book. I don't 
                    really know what it's about, but it's this book called Riemannian geometry by Brazilian mathematician 
                    Manfredo Perdigão do Carmo, and I'm probably mispronouncing that, which is not really the sort of 
                    geometry that perhaps either of us were expecting. Riemannian geometry is all about the study of like 
                    curved surfaces in many dimensional space. And I think I I spent a lot more time with the book than he 
                    did, and I eventually was just like me explaining what was happening to him. But yeah, I mean, that's 
                    not a very typical thing. Like, I did not really experience the high school math curriculum that almost 
                    all high schoolers in the country experience. Like, I have no idea what the difference between algebra 
                    one and Algebra Two is, just because I had this weird arrangement where I skipped all of that, which is 
                    not to say that that's like a prerequisite for you know, becoming a mathematician is starting really 
                    early. Like, I had a friend named davidowski, who was not into math in high school, like a classmate of 
                    mine my same year, who was not like the same level of math kid that I was at the time, but he fell in 
                    love with math in college and is now doing math or, I forget if it's Masters or PhD in UW Madison, and 
                    knows a lot more of algebraic geometry and related fields than I do. So He was here not too long ago for 
                    the mordell conference, which was at MIT. And, you know, I only was able to make it for one of the talks, 
                    just because of the way promise and timing worked out. But you know, I have very little confidence that 
                    I would be able to understand most of the talks, and it was his field, so he felt, you know, very at home 
                    in it, even though, you know, he did not start before high school the same way I did. </div>
                
                <div class="question">What do you think is the correlation 
                    between success in competition math and success in college
                    math and beyond?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I mean, they are very different skills, right? I want to, I don't want to say that 
                    one is, like, useless, like, you know, I think a lot of people say they're afraid that, like, you 
                    know, training for competition math only lets you be good at competition math, which, like, there 
                    is some truth of that that is very different from research. But, you know, it's, like, I think it's 
                    a very fun thing, and, like, you know, a very mentally demanding thing, the same way that, like, 
                    learning to solve a Rubik's Cube very fast, or, you know, memorize a deck of cards in a shuffle deck 
                    of cards in under a minute is very impressive, like, but I don't think that it has like the same 
                    relation to college math and research math that it might seem, because, like. It. I feel like there's 
                    competition questions, textbook questions and research questions, and they all have very different 
                    flavor, right? A textbook question, you are expected to be able to solve it with the techniques that 
                    happened in the chapter. All right? A competition question, you don't know what the tools you're 
                    supposed to use to bring to the table are, but you know that there is a solution that someone else 
                    has figured out, that this is a good level of difficulty for people who know about you know these 
                    tools, and there exists a solution, and we have a few in this document over here. And then research 
                    math is you have no idea if the question you're asking is solvable. You have no idea if you're even 
                    asking the right questions. And it's a lot more exploratory, right? Because research happens on the 
                    order of, like, months, if you're lucky, very often, right? And you know, competition happens in 
                    the order of half an hour. And you know, I don't know if there's a particular time scale for textbook 
                    questions, I will say like competition questions very often there it's good to, like, grab one from 
                    an old contest and stick with one problem for half an hour, or do like a session with a community 
                    on one problem for half an hour, and just like absorb everything you can get from it, because a lot 
                    of them are deeper than you are able to appreciate in the time constraints that these problems have. 
                    For what it’s worth I was, you know, and as I said, I never did competitions, but I did have a hand 
                    in setting a competition once a high school competition. So Yale has hosts something called maths, a 
                    high school math competition. Also girls in math is another thing that happens at Yale. And when I 
                    say Yale hosted, I mean it's entirely student run. The students come up with the questions, run out 
                    of time to play test the questions, because they're students and have other work to do. And then the 
                    questions end up being accidentally too hard, which is definitely what happened when I was involved 
                    like I I came on. This is 2022 I think I came on to that very late, and they said, Hey, we do not 
                    have enough questions for this competition that's happening in just like a few weeks. We need to just 
                    brainstorm and come up with a bunch of random stuff as quickly as possible. Five of the things I came 
                    up with ended up on there. I have no idea if they were the right level of difficulty, because we 
                    couldn't get people to test them before it happened. Actually, that's a lie. I gave one to someone I 
                    knew on Discord who happened to be like an IMO medalist, I think, and he solved it in the span of 15 
                    minutes, which is pretty impressive. But like that test, the time controls were such that you only 
                    really had five minutes for question, which probably todl us that wasn't the right move. It ended up 
                    being like, the max score was eight out of 12 on a bunch of rounds. Po-Shen Loh's daughter won it. </div>

                <div class="question">What do you enjoy most about teaching or helping others
                    with math?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I mean, I get excited by this stuff. I like to get other people excited about the same 
                    same stuff stuff I'm excited by. There's also like a selfish level to it, which is that I understand 
                    something a lot better if I explain it to someone else. Right? The minicourses that I gave, right? So the 
                    counselors can give minicourses to the students, generally around an hour. The only reason I was able to give 
                    those mini courses was because I had tried to explain those same topics one on one to people in the past, 
                    and I saw like where they got stuck or where I realized that I didn't fully understand it as much as I thought
                    I did, and that informed how I was able to talk about it, and that sort of informed how my lesson plan was for 
                    proving that Pi is irrational, or explaining what homology is. I have this online community. I'm a part of a 
                    Discord server focused on math, and any time I explain to someone on there wat like an injunction is in category 
                    theory or what have you, I find I understand the topic by the end of it way better than I did at the start.

                <div class="question">Have you ever had a frustrating moment in math or stem 
                    that made you want to give up? How did you deal with this?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I'm kind of in the middle of one now, and have been for a while. Well, I mean, here's the thing, when 
                    I was younger, because, as I mentioned, I started studying math pretty young, because my parents sort of put a lot of actual 
                    money into buying a lot of books for me. And, you know, my prize, like the one possession I have, material possession, I have 
                    on this earth that I value above everything else is my bookshelf, partly for sentimental value. Anyway, I remember at one point 
                    , when I was really young, deciding that I had hit a brick wall with differential equations, that I had learned calculus before 
                    most poeple learned calculus, and then I got to differential qeuations. I could get it, and that was fine. That was where my wall was. 
                    And then eventually I learned differential equations, and I think that was just like this mental thing for me, of like, okay, maybe 
                    this concept of a wall doesn't actually exist. So one thing I've been trying to learn for a while is algebraic geometry and 
                    commutative algebra, and for whatever reason, every time I've picked up a book to try to learn about it, I've gotten stuck.
                    I've got a tiny bit into the book and said, okay, I can't understand what's happening here anymore. And, like, I was reading all these
                    algebraic geometry books, and was like, okay, I think the issue is that I need to brush up on a prereq. Maybe I need to learn some 
                    commutative algebra first. So I got a commutative algebra book, a big fat one written by someone named Eisenbud. I was like, okay, this 
                    is too much. I'll give this back to the person I borrowed it from. I'm going to get a smalled one called Atiyah and MacDonald's. That's 
                    sort of where I am. And right now it's more that particular book is more exercises than exposition, like basically like a small 
                    amount of text and then a lot of exercises. And I was thinking I would be able to get to them, some of them during PROMYS. And it turns out 
                    I just didn't have any time. But like, I've just been frustrated with this one subject of commutative algebra for a long time. 
                    And like, I'm just persevering because I know that I've hit a wall in the past and been able to get through it.  
                </div>

                <div class="question">Have you done math research before. If so, what was the 
                    process like?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I was involved in an REU in college. So REU stands for research experience for undergrads. This is during COVID. It was entirely
                    virtual. The other two people on my team understood the topic way better than I did. I did not really have a great time, and I don't think I got much 
                    out of it, which is a shame. I mean, I've talked to other poeple since then, and they said that REUs are overrated, which may be true. I can't really
                    say from where I'm sitting. But, like, that's the only formal reserach experience I've had. But I don't know. I'm constantly thinking about random stuff.
                    Like, right now I'm thinking about these random probability puzzles. I'm going to explain this one niche thing. Choose four random points between zero 
                    and one, sort them from least to greatest, label them A, B, C, D, from least to greatest. And then you can ask things like, what's the probability that A 
                    squared plus D squared is bigger than B squared plus C squared? So sum of the outer squares is bigger than the sum of the inner 
                    squares. Or you can ask, what's the probability that one over A plus one over D is bigger than one over B plus one over C, same thing but with reciprocals. 
                    Well it works out that with the first one with squares, the probability is exactly the natural logarithm of 2. And with the second one, the probability is 
                    exactly pi squared minus 9. And there's a whole family of generalizations of these problems which are leading me to some wacky integrals that I don't really 
                    know how to solve. But hopefully the internet does so I've been asking some questions on math StackExchange. I  was just synthesizing other 
                    stuff I'd been thinking about in the past. There's a certain geometric shape you can get by intersecting three hyperboloids that ends up, surprisingly, to 
                    have a volume of exactly log two, for some reason. And then I was thinking about some other probability stuff, and then I realized, hey, wait a minute, 
                    that first thing, the volume thing, can be recast into the language of probability, and then it becomes this weird puzzle kind of, 
                    yeah, I don't know. There's another topology thing that I was thinking about a while ago which, like I was trying to ask people online, 
                    hey, does anyone know the solution to this one very specific topology question? And then nobody ever saw those posts I made, and then I solved it myself,
                     because no one else was and that came from thinking about a random thing in a book I read once, or like, I read another thing in a book more recently, 
                     which was, like this number theory thing. And I realized, hey, if you change that two to a three, what happens, and then that led me to, like, 
                     discovering this number sequence that seemingly did not exist online, but had a bunch of really weird properties. So I ended up submitting that to 
                     the OAS, which is this online database, or it's called the online encyclopedia of integer sequences. Anyway, just like, stuff I'm reading about and 
                     realizing, like, hey, that makes me think about something else I saw once. I don't know, but like, that's not formal research, in the sense that, 
                     like, I never turned any of them into a paper. I never really wrote any of this stuff down, except, like, bits and pieces of it on Stack Exchange and 
                     on like, Discord servers or a Facebook group called actually good mathematics problems.

                <div class="question">Please describe your experience with PROMYS. What unique 
                    understanding or insights have you gained?
                </div>
                <div class="answer"> I really like teaching, and so this is my second year as a counselor. I've never been 
                    here in any other capacity than as a counselor. So I've never been here as a student, but I was here last 
                    year. Last year, I taught three mini courses. Well, two mini courses and one counselor seminar. This year, 
                    I taught too many courses, and I just had a lot of fun doing that. It was just like explaining this one 
                    topic of my choice to a classroom full of people is something I don't very often get the chance to do 
                     so I'm grateful for promise, for the opportunity to do that, also 
                    just the opportunity to hang out with these incredibly, mathematically talented kids who are as excited 
                    about this subject as I Am  and willing to learn and all that.  
                    How exactly did you phrase the question, like,  what unique insights or understanding 
                    have you gained? I mean,  I don't promise is a lot of work on the student side, like you know, 
                    as someone who's never been a student, it seems like a lot of work to do all of these problems every 
                    night, even though you obviously don't have to complete the whole thing every night, and sort of doing 
                    the exploration on your own first before the lecture gets to it. I think that's a very like great way to 
                    do pedagogy, to do teaching that doesn't really have the opportunity to exist in a lot of other places 
                    because, like, it's such a full focused thing that you can't really have that sort of experience taking 
                    a lecture course in university. For example, just because, if you're taking a lecture course at university, 
                    you're also taking four or five others, right, or three or four others, and you're splitting your time. And 
                    this is like condensing a whole, like semester long or a year long course into the span of a month and a half, 
                    and asking students to focus on this one thing extremely deeply, just like the fact that that can exist and 
                    it can happen well, is a very nice thing about promise. </div>

                <div class="question">How do you intend to use math in your future career?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">I plan to remain in academia.  I like teaching.  
                    I want to stay, you know, in a situation where I can do teaching. So, like, My career goal is to become 
                    a professor at a university or potentially teaching at high school, I personally would like prefer the 
                    university route, but, you know, depends on how things shake out. You know, I  
                    don't know that I have full control over that. I And yeah. So 
                    I guess if the question is, how does, how do you plan to use math as a math teacher that doesn't, yeah, 
                    yeah. But you know, like, hopefully I could create something 
                    that's actually useful to someone who, you know, who wants math more than just for the sheer pleasure 
                    of learning it, you know, like, hopefully I can help with something 
                    that has, you know, applications to some algorithm or something I don't know, I don't know that I really 
                    have full control over that either, but I don't know. It's just like math has been my passion and my hobby 
                    for my entire life, and I want to turn that into my career. </div>
